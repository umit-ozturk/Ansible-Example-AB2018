options:
  provider:
    description:
      - B(Deprecated)
      - "Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using C(connection: network_cli)."
      - This option is only required if you are using NX-API.
      - For more information please see the L(NXOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_nxos.html).
      - HORIZONTALLINE
      - A dict object containing connection details.
    default: null
    suboptions:
      host:
        description:
          - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote
            device over the specified transport.  The value of host is used as
            the destination address for the transport.
        required: true
      port:
        description:
          - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote
            device.  This value applies to either I(cli) or I(nxapi).  The port
            value will default to the appropriate transport common port if
            none is provided in the task.  (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
        required: false
        default: 0 (use common port)
      username:
        description:
          - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to
            the remote device.  This value is used to authenticate
            either the CLI login or the nxapi authentication depending on which
            transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the
            value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME) will be used instead.
        required: false
      password:
        description:
          - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to
            the remote device.  This is a common argument used for either I(cli)
            or I(nxapi) transports. If the value is not specified in the task, the
            value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD) will be used instead.
        required: false
        default: null
      timeout:
        description:
          - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device
            for either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is
            exceeded before the operation is completed, the module will error.
            NX-API can be slow to return on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).
        require: false
        default: 10
        version_added: 2.3
      ssh_keyfile:
        description:
          - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to
            the remote device.  This argument is only used for the I(cli)
            transport. If the value is not specified in the task, the
            value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE) will be used instead.
        required: false
      transport:
        description:
          - Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the
            remote device.  The transport argument supports connectivity to the
            device over cli (ssh) or nxapi.
        required: true
        default: cli
      use_ssl:
        description:
          - Configures the I(transport) to use SSL if set to true only when the
            C(transport=nxapi), otherwise this value is ignored.
        required: false
        default: no
        choices: ['yes', 'no']
      validate_certs:
        description:
          - If C(no), SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used
            on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.  If the transport
            argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
        choices: ['yes', 'no']
        default: null
      use_proxy:
        description:
          - If C(no), the environment variables C(http_proxy) and C(https_proxy) will be ignored.
        default: 'yes'
        choices: ['yes', 'no']
        version_added: "2.5"
